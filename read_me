run_synthesis.m 
    i) create a nondeterministic finite transition system, 
       * load_sys1() creates the system from scratch and is slow to run
       * load_sys1('load') loads a pre-computed system and is fast to run
    ii) label the safe states
    iii) synthesize a safety controller 
    
run_sim.m 
    i) simulate the closed-loop system with the sythesized safety controller (saved in 'everything.mat')
    ii) the position of the latest item that pops out is selected by the environment (i.e., the user)
